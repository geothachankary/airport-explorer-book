# Using the Google Places API to augment the airport information

The information we are currently displaying about an airport is limited to the airport name and IATA code. As you have seen when we designed the info card, we left a placeholder to place an image of the airport. We can also add more information about each airport such as the address, phone number, website address, etc.

To get this information we will be using the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/). Google Places allow you to get detailed information about over 100 million places across various categories. You know when you click on a place on Google Maps and it opens a side panel with more information? Well, we can get that same information using the Google Places API. Let's look at how we can use it to retrieve more information about an airport.
