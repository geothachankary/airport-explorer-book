# Format of this book

I am trying to keep this book focused on building the application and not deviate too much into other, deeper technical discussions. But I also do understand that in many instances there will be some of you who are unfamiliar with the concepts being discussed, or would like to explore a particular subject in more detail.

As such I will link to relevant reference materials from Microsoft and other sources where available so you can explore in more detail at your own leisure. In many instances I have also included a "Learn More" section which will summarise this links you can refer to for more information.
