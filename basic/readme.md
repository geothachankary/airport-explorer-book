# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

As stated before, this book assumes a basic understanding of C# and building ASP.NET Core applications using either Visual Studio or the .NET Core command line tools along with a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.

As such, you will need to have Visual Studio 2017 installed which can be downloaded from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/. Alternatively you can download the .NET Core SDK from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ and Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/.

If you are unfamiliar with using these tools and buiding apps with ASP.NET Core, then I suggest you read [The Little ASP.NET Core Book](https://www.recaffeinate.co/book/) by Nate Barnettini first. Once you have a familiarity with those, then you can return to this book.

Please note that for the purpose of this book I will demonstrate using Visual Studio 2017. If you want to follow along with the .NET Core CLI and your own code editor you are welcome, but I will assume that you are proficient enough to know how to use those tools to create a project, add files, run your project, etc.

## Format of this book

I am trying to keep this book focused on building the application and not deviate too much into deeper technical discussions. But I also do understand that in many instances there will be some of you who are unfamiliar with the concepts being discussed, or would like to explore a particular subject in more detail.

As such I will link to relevant reference materials from Microsoft and other sources where available so you can explore in more detail at your own leisure. You can find these links either in-line or in the "Learn More" section included in some sections.
