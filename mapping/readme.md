# Mapping the airports

We will need a list of airports to display on our map. Thankfully a free data set containing the list of airports around the world is available on the [OpenFlights website](https://openflights.org/). The free versions of their data sets are not very up to date, but it is recent enough for us to use.

We will also need to display the list of airports on a map. For this we will be using [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com/).

In this section of the book, we will be looking at how to download the list of airports and display them on the map.
