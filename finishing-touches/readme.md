# Adding finishing touches

We now have a working application, but there are a few finishing touches we can add. It would be nice to automatically go to a user's current location. For example, I am currently situated in Bangkok, so it would be great if the application could start of zoomed in to Bangkok.

It would also be nice if a user can more easily navigate to a specific city by searching for the city in a search box, instead of having to pan and zoom to find the place they are looking for.
