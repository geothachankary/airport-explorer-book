# Prerequisites

As stated before, this book assumes a basic understanding of C# and building ASP.NET Core applications using either Visual Studio or the .NET Core command line tools along with a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.

As such, you will need to have Visual Studio 2017 installed which can be downloaded from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/. Alternatively you can download the .NET Core SDK from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ and Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/.

If you are unfamiliar with using these tools and buiding apps with ASP.NET Core, then I suggest you read [The Little ASP.NET Core Book](https://www.recaffeinate.co/book/) by Nate Barnettini first. Once you have a familiarity with those, then you can return to this book.

Please note that for the purpose of this book I will demonstrate using Visual Studio 2017. If you want to follow along with the .NET Core CLI and your own code editor you are welcome, but I will assume that you are proficient enough to know how to use those tools to create a project, add files, run your project, etc.
