# Conclusion

This brings us to the conclusion of this application. There are a few more improvements which can be done, and I will try and get to those over the next few weeks. If you want to be notified when updates are released, please subscribe to my [ASP.NET Weekly Newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/aspnetweekly) as I will announce updates in there.

I will also announce any further professional courses I develop in the ASP.NET Weekly newsletter with exclusive discounts for subscribers. So if you like this material, and are interested in more advanced, paid books and courses I will develop in the future, then please sign up as well.

Besides all of that, if you are an ASP.NET developer who just want to stay updated with the latest in the ASP.NET world, then it is also beneficial for you to sign up. Every week I feature a curated list of all the best ASP.NET related blog posts in the newsletter.
